# Requirements for ecommerce website

- First of all we must know the number of active user on the website before creating the website.
- If the number of user is less than 5k we must use php/wix/wordpress to create our websites.
- If the number of user if in lakhs than we must go for react and node to handle the traffic.
- It's bad to call too many APIs on our website, so to avoid this we only make one API using GRAPHQL.
- In GraphQL the url remain same and the connection in the website do not break.
- There are two types of call on the website 
    - Options Call (just to check if the server is up & running)
    - API call
